<h3> 3. FNAF: Security Breach</h3>
<p>
The show is set in a Chuck E Cheese-style pizzeria (named Freddy Fazbearâ€™s Mega Pizzaplex), filled with arcade games, balloons, and other fun stuff,<br> as well as those terrifying animatronic creatures that terrified us as kids in the 1980s and 1990s.<br>
<br>
You play as Gregory, who gets trapped overnight at the beginning of the game. You must keep a close eye on the security cameras.<br>
 Animatronics prowl the streets and relentlessly pursue all intruders at night. These games, unsurprisingly,<br> are full of jump scares.<br>

<h3> 4. Genshin Impact</h3>
<p>
As sad as I am to say this, this popular game is a large, free exploration RPG that can be played anywhere and on any device.<br> So, you would see a pair of magical twins roaming across universes for no apparent reason<br> (to find each other) when an unknown and powerful deity thinks they are too full of themselves to leap between realities as they like and that this must come to an end.<br>

As a result, the self-proclaimed goddess kidnaps one and takes the power of the other,<br> leaving them trapped in a strange land, searching for their sister and a way home.<br>

<h3>5. Minecraft:PE</h3>
<p>Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios.<br> The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011,<br> with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game in history, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021 and has been ported to several platforms.<br>
<br>
In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials,<br>
 craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world.<br> Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight).<br> There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.<br>
